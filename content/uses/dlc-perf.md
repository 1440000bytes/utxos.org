The post discusses how OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (CTV) significantly improves the
performance of Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) on Bitcoin. It details the current
state of DLC protocols, the computational complexities involved, and how CTV
can optimize these processes. By using CTV and Taproot, DLCs can reduce
computational costs and data exchanges, simplify threshold oracle setups, and
eliminate certain multiplications. These improvements make DLC transactions
faster and more efficient, even on resource-constrained devices, though with
some trade-offs in witness size and transaction distinguishability.
